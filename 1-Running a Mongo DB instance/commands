1 - docker ps -> show docker containers running
2 - docker ps -a -> show all docker containers (history)
3 - docker run mongo -> pull mongo docker image from docker hub if not present and 
                        instanciate a container
4 - docker run -d mongo -> the same as the command numer 3, but this time -d parameter
                           indicates that it's going to run as a daemon or background process,
                           if we kill the terminal, the container is still runinng
5 - docker stop $container_id -> we stop the container with id $container_id                                                    
6 - docker run -p 27017:27017 -d mongo -> this will start up a mongo container running in background and 
                                          it will allow applications to talk with mongo through port 27017
